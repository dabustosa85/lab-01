        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in 1985, Chile. I started to study secretariat to be able to emancipate myself, it was a short, easy and well demanded career. After working for a year I got married and my husband started to teach me his design and programming work. Then we decided that starting an agency would be a good alternative and we did it, after three years I decided to study programming and once I finished I decided to take courses in graphic design and web design. <br>
            Our agency has lasted 12 years in Chile and provided us with education, health and security for our family (we have two children of 11 and 15 years old) however our country has become a dangerous place to live and that is why we decided to sell everything and come to Canada this year. <br>
            Our goal is to create an agency again but in three years, to have enough time to learn and manage English and to learn the Canadian market, which is very different from the Chilean one.
